# EEG-Based Emotion Prediction Model Using MUSE 2

This repository is dedicated to the development of an EEG-based emotion prediction model using the MUSE 2 headband. The project focuses on collecting and analyzing EEG signals while participants engage with video stimuli, aiming to predict emotional states through sophisticated machine learning techniques. Each participant's EEG data is collected from four electrodes (TP9, TP10, AF7, AF8) and is paired with self-reported emotional ratings using a valence scale immediately following each video.
Key Features

Data Collection: Automated, synchronized collection of EEG data and emotional ratings post-video viewing ensures accuracy and relevance of the data.
    Preprocessing: Implements techniques to clean and filter EEG data, preparing it for effective analysis.
    Feature Extraction: Extracts meaningful features from the EEG data that correlate with emotional states, enhancing the predictive power of the model.
    Model Training: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to predict emotions based on EEG-derived features.
    Evaluation: Conducts thorough evaluations to validate the model's accuracy and robustness against unseen data.
    User Guide: Provides detailed instructions for setting up the experiment, including hardware setup, participant instructions, and data recording protocols.

## Goals
Model Development: Develop an accurate and reliable model for predicting emotional states from EEG data.
    Research Framework: Provide a solid framework for further research into brain-computer interfaces and emotion analysis.
    Community Collaboration: Offer a community-driven platform for enhancements and collaborative development.
